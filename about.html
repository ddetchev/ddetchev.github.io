    </div>
      <p style = "color: white">Hi! My name is Daniel Detchev, and I am a second-year intended Computer Science Major at UC Berkeley! Lob has exactly the qualities I am looking for in an internship and develops programs and APIs that
      directly correlate with the reason I got into computer science! My family is from Bulgaria, and in the few times I have visited the country, I have seen the vastly different conditions my grandparents live in. They are largely
      disconnected from any advanced technology, so reaching them from across the world becomes even more difficult. I aspired to become a software engineer in hopes of creating software for various widely beneficial reasons, such as
      granting users of the software or system in more impoverished, technologically remote areas the ability to access information and a source of clear communication from anywhere in the world, with an easy-to-use interface. I hope to
      bring this software to life potentially in the form of some type of hardware generally accessible to the public (or extremely affordable, unlike smartphones, etc.), which is why I am currently invested in learning about Computer Architecture
      and all the workings behind computers. I have dabbled in instruction sets like RISC-V and come closer to learning the immense amount of background processes a computer (or any digital hardware) automatically does. From this internship, I
      thus believe I would greatly benefit in learning to develop APIs that help connect the online world to the physical world. This would take me closer to learning how I could use the knowledge I learn to target connection to the physical world in
      remote, underprivileged areas. I have a lot to learn, so the opportunity to work directly on such personally applicable software in an internship setting and collaborate with other expert programmers and teams to help reach the company's goals is
      exactly what I am looking for in an internship that I would be excited to pursue at Lob!
